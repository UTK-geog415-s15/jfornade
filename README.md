Hey y'all! My name is Jack Fornadel and I am a junior from Virginia, right outside of Washington, DC. I am currently involved with various groups around campus, ranging from giving tours of campus to high schoolers to a campus ministry called Vols for Christ. After graduation, I would like to be a teacher. But, doing geogrpahy professionally is sounding sweeter with every uppper level class I take. 
I really enjoy watching movies, ranging from Gran Torino, to Dark Knight Rises, to Moonrise Kingdom. I reall am not picky. But, the only type I am picky about is horror movies, and will not watch them. I also really enjoy reading books too, becuase I like to think that I am well read. My favorite series is Girl with the Dragon Tatoo, and Harry Potter (I am still a kid at heart). 
For one more ice breaker that everyone loves: if I had to have any superpower, what would it be and why? I would easily be a wizard. like I said, I'm still a huge kid at heart and am fervently waiting for my Hogwarts acceptance letter.
